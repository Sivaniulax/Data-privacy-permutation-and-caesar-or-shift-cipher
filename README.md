The iypnb fille includes the code of  Caesar cipher and Permutation  cipher of cryptography.


Caesar cipher:

 The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies.

  It is a shift cipher and encrypts the data by replacing the original letters with those “x” number of characters ahead in the alphabet.

 Permutation  cipher:

  It uses the plaintext message letters but rearranges their order.

  write out the ciphertext in columns (the same number as the length of the keyword). We then order the keyword alphabetically, and write the ordered keyword at the top of the columns
